**** Array:

 An array is a special variable , which can hold moren than one value at a time  
 - The Array object let's you store multiple values in a single variable
  - Array is used for creating list, storing cities , student names etc
 - In array we use loop , if conditions to look stored values
 - For-of loop or for-each loop 
 - Inside array we can store objects i.e 
   family=[{name:hammad},{img="abc.jpg"},{title:"netflix"}]
   
   
-- How storing values:

	a="ali";b="asad";c="ashir"

-- But Consider above Better solution is array

	var store=['ali','asad','ashir']
	
More mthods but Two mostly used for Creating ARRAYS:

1) var friends=['hammad','ali','asad','riaz']
2) var family=new Array('Liaqat','Rahat','Waqar','Iftikhar')
3) 
console.log(family); //["Liaqat", "Rahat", "Waqar", "Iftikhar"]
console.log (friends);	//["hammad", "ali", "asad", "riaz"]
