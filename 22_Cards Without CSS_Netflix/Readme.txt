*** Props: Practice from 22nd Vinod Thappa vido 
 - Props stands for properties 
 - provides custom element like and custom attributes
 - like <card> is cutom element <card imgsrc="abc.jpg">
 - note imgsrc is custom attribute, different from html <img src>
 - Provides different data
 -   <input type="text" value="mir" />
 - Above "type" and "value" are attributes and react can create custom attributs
 - click on Input - select an Elements - ==$0 - click on console
 > $0 //object
 > $0.value // "mir" //access object data by obj.value
 > $0.type //text
 > $0.myname //undefined //because attribute not available, but react has ability create it
 - React props are like function arguments in Javascript and attributes in html
 > react provides power for creating custom attributes 
 > Props provide different data for each "<card />", mentioned also in below practical example
 > <card> in example is custom element haveing attributes or also called as property
